Binarary representaiton
  4 bits = 1 nibble
  8 bits = 1 byte
  16 bits = half word
  32 bits = word

Mac Address Types
  Unicast: One to one
    8th bit is off
  Multicast: One to many 
    8th bit is on
  Broadcast: One to all
    All bits on

Ethernet Header and Frame
  Ether type = 13 and 14th byte  Type of Traffic
  0x0800                            IPV4
  0x0806                            ARP
  0x86DD                            IPV6
  0x8100                          VLAN Tag

Vlan = Makes a larger network into multiple smaller networks
  Vlan tag adds 4 more bytes to ethernet header right before Ether type.
RARP Request opcode = 3
RARP Response opcode = 4
