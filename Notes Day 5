  Blue Space = me or my network
  Gray Space = The internet
  Red Space = Targets network

Reconnaissance Steps
    - Network Footprinting
    - Network Scanning
    - Network Enumeration
    - Vulnerability Assessment

 Network Footprinting
      Collect information relating to target
      - Network
      - Systems
      - Organization

Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Network Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

Network Enumeration
    Network Resource and shares
    Users and Groups
    Routing tables
    Auditing and Service settings
    Machine names
    Applications and banners
    SNMP and DNS details
    Other common services and ports

passive Recon Activities
    IP Addresses and Sub-domains
    Identifying External/3rd Party sites
    Identifying People
    Identifying Technologies
    Identifying Content of Interest
    Identifying Vulnerabilities

Identifying External/3rd Party sites
    Parent/Subordinate organizations
    Clients/Customers
    Service organizations
    Partners

Dig vs Whois
    Whois - queries DNS registrar over TCP port 43
        Information about the owner who registered the domain
    Dig - queries DNS server over UDP port 53
        Name to IP records
        
Zonetransfer over DNS TCP port 53

   Scanning Approach
    Aim
        Wide range target scan
        Target specific scan
    Method
        Single source scan
            1-to-1 or 1-to-many
        Distributed scan
            many-to-one or many-to-many 
            
Port range is 20 - 23 and 80 for a horizontal scan

Ping
    Ping one IP:
    ping 172.16.82.106 -c 1
    Ping a range:
    for i in {1..254}; do (ping -c 1 172.16.82.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ; done

NMAP Defaults
    Default Scan:
        User: TCP Full Connect Scan (-sT)
        Root: TCP SYN Scan (-sS)
    Default Ports scanned: 1000 most commonly used TCP or UDP ports
