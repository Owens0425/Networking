Tunneling is encapsulation
  - Ipv6 transition (ipv6 over ipv4) 
    - Requerires a Dual Stak Router
Traffic Tunneling - Used mainly for IPv4 to IPv6 migration
Tunneling Malware and Attacks
  - Bypass IPv4-based secrity measures
ISATAP = Mac Adress
Covert Channels
  - Common or legitamate protocols used in illegitimate ways. 
Types of Covert Channels
  - Storage
    - Pyload 
    - Header
    - Timing
  -Common Channels
    - ICMP
    - DNS
    - HTTP
Steganography
  - Hiding messages inside legitimate information 
    - Injection: putting it inside/adding stuff to something
    - Substitution: Swapping something/small usually
    - Propagtion: Building something new by combining the normal material with the malicious material from scratch


SSH
  - V1 & V2
SSH Architecture
      Client vs Server vs Session

    Keys:

        User Key - Asymmetric public key used to identify the user to the server

        Host Key - Asymmetric public key used to identify the server to the user

        Session Key - Symmetric key created by the client and server to protect the sessionâ€™s communication
SSH Port Forwarding
  - Channel created with SSH-CONN protocol
  - Allows tunneling of other services through SSH
SSH Options
    -L - Creates a port on the client mapped to a ip:port via the server

    -D - Creates a port on the client and sets up a SOCKS4 proxy tunnel where the target ip:port is specified dynamically

    -R - Creates the port on the server mapped to a ip:port via the client

    -NT - Do not execute a remote command and disable pseudo-tty (will hang window)
